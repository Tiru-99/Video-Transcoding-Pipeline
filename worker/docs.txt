Store the output in the different bucket again using a queue for good retries , also implement a good retry logic for uplaoding videos to s3 again 

use some sepearte services here like 
different for 480 p and other resolutions  , retry mechanism if something fails 
because if one of resolutions failed the whole process has to be restarted again , 
check for idempotency here as well , that if this exists in the s3 to avoid duplication 
at the end add an aggregator service to aggregate the results into master m3u8 file which will be then used for streaming
